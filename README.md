# Electroholics Website

This website is built using Jekyll.
Props to [this repo](https://github.com/rohanchandra/type-theme)
for the theme, which we later modified to our taste.

Posts in the blog are written using standard Markdown. Do take a look at the
sample blog post in the `_posts` folder and [this page](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/),
before starting off.
