title: About Us
---

Electroholics is a group of hardware enthusiasts from IIIT-Delhi.
We believe in the spirit of creativity and open knowledge, and using
these to make awesome things.

## How to Join

If you love tinkering around with circuits, or programming microcontrollers
like the Arduino<sup>1</sup> to do interesting tasks, this club is for you.

To join us, you must make a project involving a complex design component,
or you must show significant contributions to any open-source library for
hardware. 

We also carry out projects of our own throughout the year, so you can join
those at any time and get your hands dirty.

<sub>1: The Arduino isn't a microcontroller, it's technically a microcontroller board,
but we digress.</sub>
